# book-recommendation-system-collaborative-filtering
User-based collaborative filtering recommender system using sparse matrices and LIBSVM format on the Book-Crossing dataset (1M+ ratings).

The workflow is split into two Jupyter notebooks:

---

## Notebooks

### Task 1 – Data Preparation
- Built a **user–book sparse matrix** from ratings data
- Stored the matrix efficiently in **LIBSVM format**
- Generated user and book index mappings

### Task 2 – Recommender System
- Implemented **KNN-based collaborative filtering (K=10)**
- Used similarity metrics to find nearest users
- Generated **top-5 personalized book recommendations**
- Exported results in CSV format
